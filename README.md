Then our repo was quickly moved to IPFS Shipyard and made open-source. It currently contains the following components:

A golang part which exposes the essential functions for the init of the node and the functions related to the RequestBuilder
Two Swift and Java packages that facilitate node management and send requests from these native languages
Two demo applications for Android and iOS using gomobile-ipfs that simply download a random XKCD over IPFS
